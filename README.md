# ‚ùì DeBERTa-Based Extractive Question Answering (SQuAD v2 Style)

> A transformer-based QA model with DeBERTa and SQuAD v2 logic ‚Äî span prediction meets answerability.

![qa-model-diagram](./assets/qa_model_architecture.png)

This repository contains a **work-in-progress extractive question answering system** that leverages the power of **transformer models** to understand and answer natural language queries based on context. The model is inspired by the **SQuAD v2** dataset structure, which includes both **answerable and unanswerable** questions.

## üîç Project Overview

This QA system focuses on two primary objectives:

1. **Span Prediction:** Identifying the exact start and end token positions of the answer within the given context.
2. **Answerability Classification:** Determining whether the question can be answered based on the provided passage (i.e., handling `[NO_ANS]` cases).

The model is currently built using `microsoft/deberta-v3-base` and is designed to be lightweight, extensible, and adaptable for multilingual or domain-specific datasets.
